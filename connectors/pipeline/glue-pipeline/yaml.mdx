In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Glue connector.

Configure and schedule Glue metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)

<ExternalIngestionDeployment />

## Requirements

The Glue connector ingests metadata through AWS [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/glue.html) Client.
We will ingest Workflows, its jobs and their run status.

The user must have the following permissions for the ingestion to run successfully:

- `glue:ListWorkflows`
- `glue:GetWorkflow`
- `glue:GetJobRuns`

### Python Requirements

<PythonRequirements />

To run the Glue ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[glue]"
```

## Metadata Ingestion

All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/glueConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Glue.

In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.

The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)

### 1. Define the YAML Config

This is a sample config for Glue:

{% codePreview %}

{% codeInfoContainer %}

#### Source Configuration - Service Connection

<AwsConfigDef />

{% partial file="/v1.9/connectors/yaml/pipeline/source-config-def.mdx" /%}

<IngestionSinkDef />

<WorkflowConfigDef />

{% /codeInfoContainer %}

{% codeBlock fileName="filename.yaml" %}

```yaml {% isCodeBlock=true %}
source:
  type: gluepipeline 
  serviceName: local_glue
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: GluePipeline
      awsConfig:
```

{% partial file="/v1.9/connectors/yaml/pipeline/source-config.mdx" /%}

<IngestionSink />

<WorkflowConfig />

{% /codeBlock %}

{% /codePreview %}

<IngestionCli />
