In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Wherescape connector.

Configure and schedule Wherescape metadata workflow from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
    - [Connection Details](#connection-details)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/pipeline/wherescape/troubleshooting)

<IngestionModeTiles yamlPath="/snippets/connectors/pipeline/wherescape/yaml" />

## Requirements
To extract Wherescape metadata, we need the batabase connection details where the metadata is stored.

- `API` Permission ( While Creating the User, from Admin -> User )
- To retrieve lineage data, the user must be granted [Component-level permissions](https://docs.matillion.com/metl/docs/2932106/#component).

#### Connection Details

- **Connection**: Wherescape metadata database connection.

In terms of `connection` we support the following selections:

- **Microsoft SQL Server**: To connect to the Wherescape metadata database:
  - Provide the SQL Server connection credentials including username and password
  - Specify the database name where Wherescape metadata is stored
  - Enter the host and port for the SQL Server instance
  - The connector will establish a connection to this database to extract Wherescape pipeline metadata
