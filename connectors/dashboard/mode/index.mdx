In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Mode connector.

Configure and schedule Mode metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/dashboard/mode/troubleshooting)

<IngestionModeTiles yamlPath="/snippets/connectors/dashboard/mode/yaml" />

## Requirements

OpenMetadata relies on Mode's API, which is exclusive to members of the Mode Business Workspace. This means that only resources that belong to a Mode Business Workspace can be accessed via the API.

## Metadata Ingestion

<MetadataIngestionUi connector={"Mode"} selectServicePath={"/images/connectors/mode/select-service.png"} addNewServicePath={"/images/connectors/mode/add-new-service.png"} serviceConnectionPath={"/images/connectors/mode/service-connection.png"} />
